    'About Eye Shapes\n\nGenerally there are considered to be six eye shapes, these six shapes can be divided into 3 parts.\n\n- Upturned/Downturned :- How higher or lower your inner eye is than your outer eye\n\n- Roundness :- How Round your eye appears, people with large round eyes are said to have round eyes and people with narrower eyes are said to have Almond shape eyes\n\n- Hooded/monolid :- If the skin from your eyebrow comes down to cover your eyelid your eyes are hooded....the flatter / less your eyelid is covered the closer your eyes are to monolids';

    '- The overall appearance of your eyes is influenced by how close or far apart your eyes are and also how deep your eyes sit into your skull or appear to protrude outwards.\nThese lead to the descriptive terms wide-set (eyes are far apart), close-set (eyes are close together) and deep-set.\n\nYour eyes are a combination of all of these features, generally people will take the most prominent feature and use it to describe your eyes\n\ne.g if you have very large round eyes, little up/downturn and a slight hood people will describe your eyes as round. However for most people you will be a mix of everything (it\'s probably why you downloaded this app, since its difficult to tell your shape at a glance). \n\nThis app can analyse everything except for how deep-set your eyes are and whether or not they are hooded, although we try to guide you in the correct direction.';
